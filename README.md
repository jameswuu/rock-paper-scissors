# rock-paper-scissors

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with JavaScript, specifically focusing on how to implement the game in the console. Through this project, I will gain experience in building projects from scratch, writing pseudocode, and effectively tackling problems.

### Pseudocode
1. Generate rock, paper, or scissors randomly for the computer.
2. Use Math.random() to compute the randomness.
3. If rand_num is greater than 0.00 and less than 0.33, yield rock.
4. If rand_num is greater than 0.33 and less than 0.66, yield paper.
5. If rand_num is greater than 0.66 and less than 1.00, yield scissors.
6. Prompt the user for input: either rock, paper, or scissors (case-insensitive).
7. Reject any input that is not one of the expected answers.
8. Initialize the player and computer scores.
    - Both scores shall be 0 at the beginning.
9. Increment the score after a player wins a round.
10. Declare the winner once a player reaches a score of 5.
